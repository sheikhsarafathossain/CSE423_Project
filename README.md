# Project Overview

Welcome to this project.

In this project, we have applied **SOLID principles**, **code smell refactoring**, **design patterns**, and **architectural patterns**.  
To make the implementation easier to understand, we have organized the work into **separate branches**, where each branch represents a specific stage of improvement.

---

## Branch Structure

### 🔹 `without_solid`
This branch contains the **base code** and represents the **initial stage** of the codebase.  
No refactoring, SOLID principles, or design improvements were applied at this stage.

---

### 🔹 `with_solid`
In this branch, we applied the **SOLID principles** to refactor and improve the codebase.

📄 A detailed explanation of the implementation can be found in the `README.md` file within this branch.

---

### 🔹 `code_smells`
This branch focuses on **identifying and removing code smells** from the project.

📄 A detailed explanation of the refactoring process is available in the `README.md` file within this branch.

---

### 🔹 `design_pattern`
In this branch, we applied appropriate **design patterns** to improve code maintainability, flexibility, and reusability.

📄 A detailed explanation of the applied design patterns can be found in the `README.md` file within this branch.

---

### 🔹 `architectural_pattern`
This branch demonstrates the application of **architectural patterns** to structure the system at a higher level.

📄 A detailed explanation of the architectural decisions and implementation is available in the `README.md` file within this branch.

---

## Conclusion

Each branch builds upon the previous one, showing the gradual evolution of the codebase from a basic implementation to a well-structured, maintainable, and scalable system.
